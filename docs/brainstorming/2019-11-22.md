## Interesting Interactions ##

### Picking Apples from Tree ###

* We don't need to instantiate an infinite number of apples upfront
* Somehow or another, the tree gradually replenishes / creates apples
  * Instantiate a new apple each time a `get` command is issued?
  * Tree creates new apple every few minutes, up to N apples?

* We should be able to refer to items via an alias.  Ex: "get fruit" instead of "get apple"
* We'd also like to have aliases for the tree itself.  Ex: "tree", "apple tree", "fruit tree", etc.
* TODO:
  * Combine the `canProduce` and `produce` functions.  (Possibly using a generator?)
  * Consider a different verb than "produce".  (Since "consume" has a particular meaning within adventure games)

### Opening a Container ###

* When the container is closed:
  * You cannot see its contents.  (ie: `getProps(..)` or whatever would just return an empty list...?)
* When the container is opened:
  * You can see its contents
  * You can retrieve items / etc.

### Unlocking a Container ###





## TODO ##

- Find a library for making words singular/plural
